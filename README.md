# Goals

In this project we are working on a series of dice rolling algorithms

For this we will need to be able to roll a series of different dice with custom amounts and we will need to output this roll while potentially combining it with other data.

We will try to write in a function to bookmark rolls that the user wants to use regularly.

We will write a section where the user can supply their own bonuses and maluses that can apply to their roll.
